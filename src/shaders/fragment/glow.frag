/*
 * Mathematical formulations for Fresnel Glow:
 * Let N be the normalized surface normal vector in view space.
 * Let V be the normalized view direction vector (from surface to camera).
 * The dot product cosine = dot(N, V) represents surface orientation relative to view.
 * The edge glow factor is modeled by:
 *   GlowIntensity = uCoefficient * pow(1.0 - max(0.0, dot(N, V)), uPower)
 * 
 * Final Color:
 *   Color_out = uColor * GlowIntensity
